# Eating Sushiritos

A sushirito is a burrito-sized sushi hand roll - delicious but structurally challenging. This skill covers the full experience from ordering to eating without disaster.

## When to Use This Skill

- User asks about eating sushiritos or sushi burritos
- Questions about choosing fillings or ordering strategy
- Problems with structural failure or mess
- Requests for restaurant recommendations

## Quick Start: Essential Eating Technique

### The Three Rules

1. **Never unwrap completely** - Keep the wrapper on. It's structural support, not just packaging.
2. **Bite perpendicular** - Bite straight across, not at an angle. Angled bites create weak points.
3. **Support from below** - Always keep one hand under the sushirito like a platform.

### The Wrapper Strategy

- Start with wrapper fully on
- Peel down 2-3 inches as you eat
- Stop and hold if you feel instability
- Never expose more than one bite's worth of filling

### The Napkin Nest

Create a safety net:
1. Place 2-3 napkins on the table
2. Rest sushirito on napkins between bites
3. If disaster strikes, napkins catch the fallout
4. Bonus: absorb excess moisture

## Ordering Strategy

### Rice Choice Matters

- **White rice**: Classic, sticky, structural integrity ⭐
- **Brown rice**: Healthy but less sticky - higher difficulty
- **Soy paper**: No rice, just wrapped in soy - expert mode only

**Recommendation**: Start with white rice until you master the technique.

### Protein Selection

Choose **one** protein for structural simplicity:
- Cooked options (shrimp, eel) - easier to bite through cleanly
- Raw fish (salmon, tuna) - slippery but delicious
- Avoid: Multiple proteins create uneven density

See [references/fillings.md](references/fillings.md) for comprehensive filling combinations.

### The Sauce Dilemma

**Critical**: Too much sauce = structural failure

- Ask for sauce on the side
- Apply sparingly after 2-3 bites
- Never let them add "extra" anything wet

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ The Full Unwrap
Removing all wrapper at once guarantees catastrophic failure.

### ❌ The Squeeze
Gripping too hard pushes filling out the ends. Use gentle support, not compression.

### ❌ The Conversation Bite
Taking a bite while talking creates chaos. Eat first, talk second.

### ❌ The Vertical Hold
Holding it straight up lets gravity work against you. Keep it horizontal or tilted slightly upward.

## Pro Tips

### Emergency Recovery
If structural failure begins:
1. Stop eating immediately
2. Gently compress failing section
3. Rotate sushirito 180° and eat from other end
4. Consider fork surrender (no shame)

### The Strategic Unwrap Timing
- Unwrap slowly between bites, not during
- Peel wrapper backward, don't pull forward
- If wrapper sticks to filling, leave it - forced peeling causes tears

### Advanced: The Tilt
As you reach the final third:
- Tilt sushirito upward at 15-20° angle
- Prevents end-of-burrito filling escape
- Requires confident grip

## Final Wisdom

A sushirito is not a race. Slow, deliberate bites with proper wrapper management beats speed every time. When in doubt, add more napkins.
