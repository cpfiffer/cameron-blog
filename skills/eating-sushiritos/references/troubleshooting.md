## Structural Failures

### Problem: Rice Falling Out the Bottom
**Cause**: Too much filling, not enough wrapper support, or holding at wrong angle

**Solution**:
1. Immediately rotate 180° and eat from other end
2. Place on napkin nest and compress gently
3. If beyond repair: fork and knife (no shame)

**Prevention**: 
- Never hold completely vertical
- Support from below always
- Don't order "extra" anything

### Problem: Everything Squeezing Out the Ends
**Cause**: Gripping too hard, uneven filling distribution

**Solution**:
1. Loosen grip immediately
2. Use palms, not fingers, to support
3. Eat problematic end first

**Prevention**:
- Gentle support, not compression
- Check weight distribution when you first pick it up
- If one end feels heavier, eat that end first

### Problem: Split in the Middle
**Cause**: Too much sauce, weak spot in wrapper, or angled bite

**Solution**:
1. Stop eating from that section
2. Flip and eat from opposite end
3. When you reach the split, use fork or fold it like a taco

**Prevention**:
- Bite perpendicular, never at angle
- Always request light sauce
- Check wrapper for weak spots before first bite

## Wrapper Problems

### Problem: Nori (Seaweed) Won't Bite Through
**Cause**: Old or humid nori, too thick of wrapper

**Solution**:
1. Use teeth to score a line across
2. Pull gently while biting (controlled tear)
3. Switch to pulling small pieces off with fingers

**Prevention**:
- Order during off-peak (fresher nori)
- Ask if nori is fresh that day
- Consider soy paper wrapper instead

### Problem: Wrapper Sticking to Filling
**Cause**: Too much moisture, sauce soaking through

**Solution**:
1. Don't force it - peeling makes it worse
2. Take smaller bites, wrapper and all
3. If it's really stuck, eat it together (it's edible)

**Prevention**:
- Order sauce on side
- Eat within 5 minutes of receiving (clock starts at counter)
- Don't let it sit - nori absorbs moisture fast

### Problem: Soy Paper Tearing
**Cause**: Soy paper is more delicate than nori

**Solution**:
1. Extremely gentle handling required
2. Use napkin nest method religiously
3. Consider this wrapper expert mode

**Prevention**:
- Only order soy paper if experienced
- Always eat immediately (soy paper degrades faster)
- Don't order soy paper for delivery ever

## Filling Issues

### Problem: All Protein in One Bite, Then All Rice
**Cause**: Uneven filling distribution by staff

**Solution**:
1. Before first bite, gently squeeze/massage to distribute
2. Rotate burrito as you eat to hit different sections
3. Cut in half with knife if distribution is really bad

**Prevention**:
- Watch them make it - if you see uneven layering, speak up
- Order during off-peak when staff can take more care
- Stick to restaurants with good reviews for consistency

### Problem: Too Spicy/Salty
**Cause**: Too much sauce or too much soy sauce

**Solution**:
1. Order a side of plain rice to eat between bites
2. Get water, not soda (sugar makes spice worse)
3. Avocado helps cut spice - order on the side if needed

**Prevention**:
- Always say "light sauce"
- Never ask for soy sauce inside
- If ordering spicy option, ask how spicy it is

### Problem: Too Bland
**Cause**: Not enough sauce, missing acid/brightness

**Solution**:
1. Ask for sauce on the side - add gradually
2. Soy sauce for dipping (not pouring on)
3. Pickled ginger between bites

**Prevention**:
- Order at least one sauce
- Include pickled vegetables
- Green onion adds brightness

## Mess Management

### Problem: Sauce Dripping on Clothes
**Cause**: Too much sauce, holding at wrong angle

**Solution**:
1. Tuck napkin into collar immediately (bib style)
2. Lean over plate/napkins, not over lap
3. Keep emergency stain wipes in bag

**Prevention**:
- Always use napkin nest
- Eat leaning forward, elbows on table
- Sauce on side only

### Problem: Rice Everywhere on Table
**Cause**: Structural failure, aggressive biting

**Solution**:
1. Clean as you go - push rice onto napkin nest
2. Ask for extra napkins mid-meal
3. Eat remaining rice with fork at end

**Prevention**:
- Proper napkin nest setup from start
- Smaller, controlled bites
- Don't eat while walking/moving

### Problem: Hands Covered in Sauce/Rice
**Cause**: Normal sushirito eating

**Solution**:
1. This is expected - embrace it
2. Keep wet wipes nearby
3. Eat with one hand, keep other clean for phone/door

**Prevention**:
- Can't fully prevent this
- It's part of the experience
- Some places provide gloves (use them)

## Emergency Protocols

### Critical Failure: Complete Structural Collapse
**What happened**: It's everywhere. Total disaster.

**Emergency Response**:
1. Don't panic - this happens to everyone eventually
2. Push everything into napkin nest/bowl
3. Eat with fork - it's now a "deconstructed sushirito"
4. Next time: order a poke bowl (same ingredients, better format)

**Learning moment**: What went wrong? Too much sauce? Wrong wrapper? Bad bite technique? Apply lesson to next attempt.

### Social Disaster: Collapse During Business Lunch
**What happened**: It fell apart in front of clients/colleagues

**Emergency Response**:
1. Make a joke: "This is why I usually get poke bowls"
2. Switch to fork immediately and confidently
3. Offer to get extra napkins for table (helpful recovery)
4. Continue conversation like nothing happened

**Prevention for future**:
- Never order sushirito for business meals
- Stick to poke bowls or traditional sushi for professional settings
- Save sushiritos for casual solo/friend meals

### Delivery Disaster: Arrived Completely Destroyed
**What happened**: Opened container to find chaos

**Response**:
1. Take photo for potential refund request
2. Eat with fork - it still tastes good
3. Don't try to reassemble (makes it worse)
4. Leave review noting packaging issue

**Prevention**:
- Don't order sushiritos for delivery
- If you must: only from very close restaurants (<10 min)
- Consider poke bowls instead for delivery

## Expert Recovery Techniques

### The Controlled Fold
When structural integrity is compromised but not catastrophic:
1. Fold wrapper over exposed section like a taco
2. Eat from the new "top" edge
3. Keeps filling contained while you finish

### The Strategic Sacrifice
When one end is failing:
1. Let that end fail completely onto napkin nest
2. Focus on eating the intact end
3. Eat fallen bits with fork at the end
4. You've saved 75% of burrito - that's a win

### The Fork Transition
Knowing when to surrender:
1. If you've spent more time managing than eating: fork time
2. If more than 30% has fallen out: fork time
3. If you're stressed instead of enjoying: fork time

**Wisdom**: There's no shame in using a fork. The goal is to enjoy your meal, not prove your hand-roll skills.

## When to Give Up and Order a Bowl

### Signs You Should Order a Bowl Instead
- You're eating during a meeting or while working
- You're wearing nice clothes
- You're in a car (never eat sushirito in car)
- It's being delivered
- You've had 3+ structural failures in a row
- You want to eat while walking

**Truth**: Poke bowls have all the same ingredients, taste just as good, and are 90% less likely to end in disaster. Sometimes the bowl is the right choice.

## Practice Makes Perfect

### Skill Progression
1. **Beginner**: Shrimp, cucumber, white rice, nori wrapper, light sauce
2. **Intermediate**: Salmon, multiple veggies, soy paper, moderate sauce
3. **Advanced**: Multiple fish, complex builds, eating while standing
4. **Expert**: Delivery sushirrito that still works (this may be impossible)

**Remember**: Everyone has structural failures. The difference is experienced eaters know how to recover gracefully.
