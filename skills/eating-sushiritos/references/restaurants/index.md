## What to Look For

### Quality Indicators
✅ Rice made fresh daily
✅ Separate prep area for raw fish
✅ Staff wears gloves and changes them between orders
✅ Can see your burrito being made
✅ Nori (seaweed) is crispy, not limp

### Red Flags
❌ Pre-made burritos sitting out
❌ Soggy or limp nori wrapper
❌ Rice that looks dry or hard
❌ Strong fish smell (should smell ocean-fresh, not fishy)
❌ Staff doesn't change gloves between orders

## Ordering Tips by Restaurant Type

### Fast-Casual Chains (Pokeworks, Poke Bar, etc.)
- Build-your-own is the move
- Staff are used to helping - ask questions
- Specify "light" on sauces always
- Peak hours = assembly line quality drops

**Best time**: 2-4 PM (between lunch and dinner rush)

### Dedicated Sushi Burrito Shops (Sushirrito, Buredo)
- Signature rolls are tested and balanced
- Custom builds can get expensive
- These make the biggest burritos - come hungry
- Always busy - order ahead if possible

**Best time**: Order online for pickup

### Traditional Sushi Restaurants with Burrito Option
- Usually highest quality fish
- Smaller portions, higher price
- Staff may not be experienced with burrito format
- Sometimes use too much rice

**Pro tip**: Order a hand roll instead - same concept, better execution

## Price Expectations

### Budget ($8-12)
- Poke chain build-your-own
- Vegetarian options
- Smaller portions
- Fewer premium ingredients

### Mid-Range ($12-18)
- Dedicated sushi burrito shops
- Signature builds with quality fish
- Good portion size
- This is the sweet spot ⭐

### Premium ($18+)
- Traditional sushi restaurants
- Highest quality fish
- Smaller but perfect execution
- Worth it for special occasions

## Ordering for Delivery

### Packaging Matters
Sushiritos delivered poorly = disaster

**What to ask**:
- How is it packaged? (Should be in rigid container, not just wrapped)
- How long is delivery? (Under 20 mins ideal, over 30 mins risky)
- Can I get sauce on the side? (Always yes to this)

### Delivery Tips
- Order from closest location only
- Avoid peak hours (rice quality suffers when rushed)
- Eat immediately upon arrival - nori gets soggy fast
- Consider ordering a poke bowl instead for delivery (holds up better)

**Harsh truth**: Sushiritos are best eaten fresh in-store. Delivery is always a compromise.

## Making Friends with Staff

### Good Customer Behavior
- Know what you want before reaching the counter
- Don't ask for "a little bit of everything"
- Tip well if you're building custom
- Off-peak hours = staff can give better recommendations

### Questions That Help
- "What's most popular?"
- "What's fresh today?"
- "Can you go light on the sauce?"
- "What do you recommend for a first-timer?"

### Questions That Annoy
- "Can I taste everything first?"
- "Can you make it like [describes complex custom thing]?"
- "Why is there an upcharge for [premium ingredient]?"

**Pro tip**: Staff who make sushiritos all day know the optimal builds. Trust their recommendations.
