## Classic Combinations

### The California
- Imitation crab
- Avocado
- Cucumber
- White rice
- Soy paper or nori

**Why it works**: Creamy avocado + crunchy cucumber balance. Imitation crab sticks together well.

### The Spicy Tuna
- Spicy tuna (tuna + sriracha mayo)
- Cucumber
- Avocado
- White rice
- Nori wrapper

**Warning**: Pre-mixed spicy tuna is wet. Skip additional sauce.

### The Crispy Shrimp
- Tempura shrimp
- Avocado
- Lettuce or cabbage
- Spicy mayo (light)
- White rice

**Pro tip**: Tempura texture contrasts nicely but can be hard to bite. Ask for shrimp cut in half lengthwise.

## Protein Guide

### Raw Fish

**Salmon**:
- Fatty, rich, holds shape
- Pairs well with avocado, cucumber
- Difficulty: Medium

**Tuna**:
- Lean, clean flavor
- Can be dry - needs creamy element
- Difficulty: Medium

**Yellowtail**:
- Buttery, delicate
- Harder to bite cleanly
- Difficulty: Hard

### Cooked Options

**Shrimp**:
- Clean, slightly chewy
- Easy to bite through
- Best choice for beginners

**Eel (Unagi)**:
- Pre-sauced, very soft
- Sweet flavor, tender texture
- Warning: Extra sauce makes it slippery

**Tofu**:
- Vegetarian option
- Can be bland - needs strong flavors
- Very easy to eat structurally

## Vegetable Strategy

### Essential Structure Vegetables
These provide crunch and structure:

- **Cucumber**: Crunchy, hydrating, neutral flavor ⭐
- **Carrot (julienned)**: Adds sweetness and snap
- **Cabbage**: Cheap filler but adds good crunch

### Flavor Vegetables
Add these for taste:

- **Avocado**: Creamy, rich - but makes things slippery
- **Pickled vegetables**: Adds acid and brightness
- **Green onion**: Sharp flavor, minimal structure

### What to Avoid

- **Lettuce**: Wilts fast, adds water
- **Tomato**: Too wet, destroys wrapper integrity
- **Bean sprouts**: Slippery, escape easily

## Sauce Science

### Safe Sauces (Thick, Controllable)
- Spicy mayo
- Eel sauce (unagi sauce)
- Sriracha (small amounts)

### Dangerous Sauces (Thin, Soaks Wrapper)
- Soy sauce (NEVER inside)
- Ponzu
- Regular mayo
- Wasabi cream (too thin)

### The Sauce Rule
**Maximum 1 sauce, applied lightly**. If ordering multiple ingredients "with sauce," each adds wetness. Stick to one sauce type total.

## Regional Variations

### San Francisco Bay Area
Origin of the sushirito. Most options available.
- **Sushirrito** (the chain): Large, heavily filled - difficulty: Hard
- Try: "Geisha's Kiss" or custom build with light sauce

### Southern California
Tends toward fusion and bold flavors.
- Common: Hot Cheetos crusted options (very messy)
- Watch for: "California-style" means more mayo

### East Coast
Smaller portions, more traditional flavors.
- Less experimental
- Better rice quality on average

### Midwest
Newer to the scene, conservative options.
- Cooked proteins more common
- Expect fewer adventurous choices

## Custom Build Strategy

When building from scratch:

1. **Base**: White rice
2. **Protein**: One only - salmon or shrimp recommended
3. **Crunch**: Cucumber + carrot
4. **Cream**: Avocado OR sauce, not both
5. **Accent**: Pickled ginger or green onion
6. **Wrapper**: Nori (traditional seaweed)

**Total ingredients**: 5-6 max. More = structural failure.

## Mistakes to Avoid

### The "Everything" Build
Asking for "a little of everything" creates:
- Uneven density
- Conflicting flavors
- Structural chaos
- Impossible-to-bite-through thickness

### Double Protein
Two proteins sound good but create problems:
- Uneven thickness
- One always tastes better, making other feel wasted
- Harder to bite through

### "Extra" Anything
"Extra spicy mayo" = disaster
"Extra avocado" = slippery mess
"Extra rice" = can't fit in mouth

**Rule**: Never say "extra" when ordering a sushirito.
