<p>Howdy&#33; Been a while since I posted anything on my blog. I&#39;d like to get back in the habit of posting stuff every once in a while. Writing is a good way of staying focused and thinking critically about whatever is happening at any point in time.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve just completed my move to Palo Alto. I&#39;m down here for six months or so to work on IO-adjacent topics with <a href="https://shoshanavasserman.com/">Shoshana Vasserman</a>, and hopefully meet with various other Stanford-people. The drive down &#40;Eugene → Palo Alot&#41; was brutal. We&#39;re apparently in the midst of a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/10/24/1048862514/powerful-storm-brings-heavy-rain-flooding-and-mud-flows-to-northern-california">bomb cyclone</a> or something, so it was just torrential downpour and high winds for the entirety of my two-day drive. </p>
<p>On a professional note, it&#39;s been a while since I had to scramble to do stuff. People have expectations of me and I have expectations of myself, which is absolutely wonderful to experience again. During the bulk of the pandemic, I&#39;ve been entirely adrift because I never felt like I needed to go into the office. Zero accountability to anyone &#40;including me&#41;. Now I&#39;m feeling quite a bit better. Very light, bouncy, high energy. </p>
