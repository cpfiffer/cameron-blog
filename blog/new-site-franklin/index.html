It&#39;s a static site generator written in Julia. I&#39;ve been using it for a few months now and I&#39;m really enjoying it. It&#39;s a bit more flexible than Hugo, which I was using before.</p> <p>The old website was really butched together. I had a lot of custom CSS written at a time when I knew nothing about CSS, and there was simply too much bloat. I&#39;d also had this weird-ass tufte-style thing that was just hilariously unwieldy.</p> <p>Anyway enjoy. I purged some old blog posts that were stupid but kept the good ones.</p> <div class=page-foot > Cameron Pfiffer. Last modified: April 13, 2024.
