Rust is a really spectacularly designed language with perhaps the greatest package manager.It&#39;s called <a href="https://crates.io/">Cargo</a>. I&#39;ve been continuously blown away by how lovely it is to write stuff in&#33;</p> <p>Rust is fascinating to me because it&#39;s one of my first true compiled languages. In contrast to the other languages I&#39;m somewhat good at:</p> <ul> <li><p>R &#40;mostly interpereted&#41;</p> <li><p>Python &#40;interpereted&#41;</p> <li><p>C# &#40;JIT compiled&#41;</p> <li><p>Julia &#40;JIT compiled&#41;</p> </ul> <p>I am only passingly familiar with C and have mostly repressed C&#43;&#43;, so Rust was both new and refreshing to me. The workflows are strikingly different – with Julia or R or what have you, I go through a very rapid iterative process. Write something, run it, see what worked, fix it, move on to the next issue. It&#39;s very slapdash.</p> <p>With Rust &#40;and, I presume other compiled languages&#41;, I have to stop and <em>think</em> a lot more about what I&#39;m doing and how I&#39;m doing it. This is a bit more important in Rust because of the concept of <strong>ownership</strong>, an entirely bizarre concept of who owns what thing in any given program.</p> <p>My &#40;admittedly frail&#41; understanding of ownership is that everything that exists in a program is owned by a varible. Once that variable goes out of scope, the memory allocated goes with it. It&#39;s how Rust manages memory safety. It has a pretty steep learning curve initially, but once you&#39;ve learned it it&#39;s almost effortless to use. </p> <p>All in all, it&#39;s a spectacular language. Fast, too. And ultra strongly typed with none of the rigid puritanical stuff that comes with Haskell.</p> <div class=page-foot > Cameron Pfiffer. Last modified: April 16, 2024.
