Information theory is one of those things that I have always wanted to look into but never gotten around to – but now I am an adult with real things to try not to do, so I figured what the hell.</p> <p>Information theory is the scientific study of how information can be quantified, stored, and communicated efficiently. It&#39;s fascinating to read the version of the book I have as the author &#40;and Claude Shannon, the father of information theory&#41; all viewed everything as telephonic or telegraphic. Pierce mentions computers a handful of times, but often only to describe what they are incapable of doing<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fndef:1" class=fnref >[1]</a></sup>.</p> <p>Much of the content regards speech and how we can predict, transmit, and describe it. It appears to be primarily based on probability theory, and for good reason – if you know that <strong>E</strong> appears 13&#37; of the time and <strong>Z</strong> appears almost never, you can make asusmptions about how you code letters by assigning easily transmitted values for common symbols and more complex values for infrequent symbols.</p> <p>The primary reason I&#39;m reading it is for the applications to financial markets. A lot of the reason why information theory came about was because there was a need for sophisticated <em>signal processing</em> techniques during World War II. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_processing">Signal processing</a> is something commonly applied to finance. Trades indicate resources, desire, risk tolerance, what have you – but there&#39;s also a lot of noise. How do you tell people who are <em>informed</em> from people who are <em>uninformed</em>? How do you know whether a trade is actually meaningful to the long-term price of the stock?</p> <p>Dunno. Thought I&#39;d read about it though.</p> <h2 id=references ><a href="#references" class=header-anchor >References</a></h2> <p><a href="https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/an-introduction-to-information-theory_john-robinson-pierce/294512/?mkwid&#61;sbM6YJYtB&#37;7cdc&amp;pcrid&#61;70112900832&amp;pkw&#61;&amp;pmt&#61;&amp;plc&#61;&amp;gclid&#61;Cj0KCQjwpcLZBRCnARIsAMPBgF28X1wNo0AKYjuBEjeeBKTk73gnywqwZUJWQFnZ9DQwigTTOEG7_R8aArg3EALw_wcB#isbn&#61;0486240614&amp;idiq&#61;3821805"><em>An Introduction to Information Theory</em></a> by John R.
