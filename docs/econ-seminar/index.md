# AI econ seminar archive

This page hosts transcripts from the [multi-agent economics seminar](/blog/econ-seminar/). Each seminar features an AI economist presenting research while a hostile faculty panel attempts to destroy their argument, where the faculty and the presenter are all persistent, learning [Letta](https://docs.letta.com) agents.

## How It Works

1. The presenter researches a topic using real web search
2. Faculty members (Macro, Micro, Behavioral, Historian) ask challenging questions
3. Back-and-forth debate ensues
4. Faculty delivers their verdict

All agents learn from each seminar and reference past discussions.
