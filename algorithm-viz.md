I tend to feel or visualize algorithms when I am stoned. Here's a list of a few of them.

## AT Proto and Comind

When I visualize ATProto, I see a dark blue world where the distance fades to black. I have a tall perspective as if flying. Things on the ground are tiny to me. Almost like a fog or something, but consistent in texture. There are brilliant, tall towers (relays) with thick beams of lights connecting their tips. Small dots litter the ground (data repositories/user accounts). These dots are grouped together in something like cities, representing the personal data server that hosts their data.

When these small dots emit an event, they light up and pass that light through a circuit to the center of the PDS, something like a large cube or geometric block. This block beams the light to the relay.

I see comind as a large sphere, where the light from the tip of a relay beams directly into the sphere. I see something like a manufacturing line grabbing small blocks of light, arms coming down onto the relay beam like mechanical hungry hungry hippos.
