I moved to [Franklin.jl](https://franklinjl.org) for my website. It's a static site generator written in Julia. I've been using it for a few months now and I'm really enjoying it. It's a bit more flexible than Hugo, which I was using before.

The old website was really butched together. I had a lot of custom CSS written at a time when I knew nothing about CSS, and there was simply too much bloat. I'd also had this weird-ass tufte-style thing that was just hilariously unwieldy.

Anyway enjoy. I purged some old blog posts that were stupid but kept the good ones.
