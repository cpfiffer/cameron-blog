A list of Bayesian finance papers I've noticed. These are mostly sourced from the financial economics literature, and primarily so from the top three journals (_Journal of Finance_, _Review of Financial Studies_, and the _Journal of Financial Economics_). I exclude theoretical papers because the Bayesian component is usually not the most interesting part. I favor empirical papers that use some kind of Bayesian method. Suggestions welcome!
