Howdy! Been a while since I posted anything on my blog. I'd like to get back in the habit of posting stuff every once in a while. Writing is a good way of staying focused and thinking critically about whatever is happening at any point in time.

I've just completed my move to Palo Alto. I'm down here for six months or so to work on IO-adjacent topics with [Shoshana Vasserman](https://shoshanavasserman.com/), and hopefully meet with various other Stanford-people. The drive down (Eugene → Palo Alot) was brutal. We're apparently in the midst of a [bomb cyclone](https://www.npr.org/2021/10/24/1048862514/powerful-storm-brings-heavy-rain-flooding-and-mud-flows-to-northern-california) or something, so it was just torrential downpour and high winds for the entirety of my two-day drive. 

On a professional note, it's been a while since I had to scramble to do stuff. People have expectations of me and I have expectations of myself, which is absolutely wonderful to experience again. During the bulk of the pandemic, I've been entirely adrift because I never felt like I needed to go into the office. Zero accountability to anyone (including me). Now I'm feeling quite a bit better. Very light, bouncy, high energy.
