# About me

Howdy, I'm Cameron Pfiffer.

I'm an engineer, AI person, statistician, economist, and hammock enthusiast. I like writing code for supercomputers. I love [code](https://www.github.com/cpfiffer), rowing, and [pianos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTcsdFvTCGyJ8vSp3iHuTyg?view_as=subscriber). Learning is my favorite thing.

I'm a big lover of the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) programming language. I've worked on the [Turing.jl](https://turinglang.org/stable/) project for Bayesian inference. I also head up the [JuliaGenAI](http://juliagenai.org/) project along with [Jan Siml](https://siml.earth/), which is a collection of tools for using Julia in generative AI contexts.

I was a postdoctoral researcher at [Stanford's GSB](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/).
I worked on industrial organization with [Shoshana Vasserman](https://shoshanavasserman.com/).
I received my PhD in finance from the [University of Oregon](https://business.uoregon.edu/phd/concentrations/finance).
I have a master's in finance from the [ICMA Centre](http://www.icmacentre.ac.uk/) at the [Henley Business School](http://www.henley.ac.uk/)
(which itself is part of the [University of Reading](https://www.reading.ac.uk/)), and a BSc in Technical Theater
from [Southern Oregon University](https://sou.edu/). I'm was a developer for [Turing.jl](https://turing.ml), a probabilistic programming tool.

I used to be an alpaca rancher and work for Cirque du Soleil. I'm really fun at parties, and I am a fantastic dancer.

## What I like

I tend to focus on computational topics in lots of domains, though generally I am an economist. I am currently interested in:

* Generative AI and NLP
* AI systems
* ATProtocol
* Neural network architectures
* Type systems and compilers
* Industrial organization
* Asset pricing
* Bayesian statistics

Favorite programming languages:

* [Julia](https://julialang.org/) because it's fast and fun to write!
* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) because someone told me I should learn C and I thought this was cooler.
* [R](https://www.r-project.org/) because I am a masochist.
* [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) because I forget how to take derivatives.
